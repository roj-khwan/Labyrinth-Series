# Labyrinth Series
This repository contain my project about **Labyrinth**.  
There is 2 Main Section.
## Generator
This **Folder** is use to generate maze with difference algorithm.  
this **section** contain 3 main parts.
* `Algorithm` which's use to create maze currently we only have 1.
* `Maze Image` which's is render Image of maze.
* `Encrypt maze` which's a file to use in Evaluate Section.
## Evaluate
This **Folder** is use to solve maze with difference algorithm.  
this **section** contain 3 main parts.
* `Algorithm` which's use to create solve maze currently we only have 1.
* `Maze Image` which's is render Image of solved maze.
* `Encrypt maze` which's a file come from Generate Section. Algorithm going to read this file to solve the maze.
